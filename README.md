# Diabetes-Prediction-System
The objective of the dataset is to diagnostically predict whether a patient has diabetes based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset.

## Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset

This dataset, originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK), provides valuable information for studying and predicting diabetes mellitus. It comprises diagnostic measurements from a specific population group: Pima Indian females aged 21 years or older.

### Key Features:
* **Source**: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases
* **Target**: Predict diabetes in Pima Indian women (21 years or older)
* **Data Format**: CSV
* **Variables**:
  <ul>
        <li>Independent (Predictor Variables): Medical diagnostic measurements</li>
        <li>Dependent (Target Variable): Diabetes outcome (positive or negative)</li>
  </ul>

### Potential Applications:
* Develop machine learning models to predict diabetes risk
* Explore relationships between diagnostic factors and diabetes prevalence
* Conduct research on specific demographics (Pima Indian women in this case)

### Data Considerations:
Specific demographic focus (Pima Indian females over 21) limits generalizability to other populations.
Potential for biases inherent in the original data collection process.
